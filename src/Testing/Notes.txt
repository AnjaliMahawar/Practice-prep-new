Internal state of a component
Internal methods of a component

npm run test <file name>  //if we want to run spacific file

watch mode watch all update changes and also nshow new updates 

//naming convention of testsing file 
//name.test.js    //name.spec.js //name.spec.jsx  

if we want to create multiple test file 
we can create folder __test__  under this directory all file will consider test file

snapshot testing
Snapshot testing in Jest is a technique for capturing the output of a component or function and 
storing it in a file. Subsequent runs of the test compare the current output with the saved "snapshot" 
to ensure that it hasn't changed unexpectedly. This can be particularly useful for ensuring that UI
 components remain consistent over time
RTL query type

getBy ,queryBy,findBy

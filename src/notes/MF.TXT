 Webpack is not a React concept. It is a JavaScript module bundler, independent of any specific framework.
Microfrontend is an architectural style where a frontend application is split into smaller, independent 
"micro-apps" that are developed, deployed, and maintained separately — similar to microservices in the backend world.
WAYS TO CREATE mf
1. Module Federation (Webpack 5) – ✅ Most Popular
Uses Webpack 5's built-in ModuleFederationPlugin.
Enables dynamic runtime loading of remote modules/apps.
Ideal for JavaScript-heavy SPAs.
Recommended for large-scale apps using React/Angular/Vue.

2. iframes
Each micro-app runs in its own iframe.
Total isolation.
Easy to integrate legacy systems.
Drawbacks: Poor user experience, performance overhead, communication is hard.

3. JavaScript Includes / Custom Elements
Embed scripts or Web Components (Custom Elements) in the host app.
Clean integration.
Useful for non-SPA or when only a small portion needs to be isolated.

4. Server-Side Composition (Edge-Side Includes, SSR)
Combine microfrontends on the server (e.g., using Node.js, Edge functions).
Best for multi-page applications (MPAs) or SEO-heavy apps.
Uses tools like Tailor, Podium, or custom logic.
Term----	Meaning
Host----	The main shell app that loads remote apps.
Remote---	The micro-app that exposes modules to the host.
Module Federation Plugin-----	A Webpack plugin to share code across apps at runtime.
Exposes-----	Part of remote app you want to share (e.g., Button, Header)
Remotes-------	References to other apps you want to load in host app.

 exposes: "What am I giving to others?"
 It tells Webpack what modules (components, utils, etc.) your app is exposing (sharing) with other apps.
 remotes: "What am I consuming from others?"
 It tells Webpack which external apps (remotes) you want to load and use at runtime, and where to find them.
 shared: "What libraries should we not duplicate?"
 It tells Webpack which dependencies (e.g., React, Lodash) should be shared and not duplicated across apps.
Helps reduce bundle size and avoid React rendering issues due to version mismatches.
App Structure
container (Host app)
marketing (Remote app)
##REMOTE APP
// marketing/webpack.config.js
new ModuleFederationPlugin({
  name: 'marketing',
  filename: 'remoteEntry.js',
  exposes: {
    './MarketingApp': './src/bootstrap',
  },
  shared: ['react', 'react-dom'],
});
##Host app
// container/webpack.config.js
new ModuleFederationPlugin({
  name: 'container',
  remotes: {
    marketing: 'marketing@http://localhost:8081/remoteEntry.js',
  },
  shared: ['react', 'react-dom'],
});
# Usage in Host App
import MarketingApp from 'marketing/MarketingApp';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Host App</h1>
      <MarketingApp />
    </div>
  );
}

microfrontendDoes shared mean the dependency is not installed in other apps?
No — each  still needs to install the dependencies locally via package.json.
shared means: “Let’s avoid loading this dependency twice in the browser at runtime.”
singleton: true	Makes sure only one instance of React exists across the whole microfrontend app
requiredVersion: '^18.2.0'	Defines what version of React your app expects — ensures compatibility across remotes and host

const { ModuleFederationPlugin } = require('webpack').container;
const deps = require('./package.json').dependencies;

module.exports = {
  // entry, output, resolve, etc.
  plugins: [
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      name: 'hostApp',
      remotes: {
        remoteApp: 'remoteApp@http://localhost:3001/remoteEntry.js',
      },
      shared: {
        react: { singleton: true, requiredVersion: deps.react },
        'react-dom': { singleton: true, requiredVersion: deps['react-dom'] },
      },
    }),
  ],
};

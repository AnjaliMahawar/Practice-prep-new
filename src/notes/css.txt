css position  margine and padding

1. static (default)
This is the default positioning for all elements.
Elements are placed in the normal document flow — top to bottom, left to right.
Top, right, bottom, and left properties have no effect.

div {
  position: static;
}
2. relative
The element is positioned relative to its normal position.
You can use top, right, bottom, left to “nudge” it from where it would normally be.
The space it would have taken up is still preserved.

3. absolute
The element is removed from the normal document flow.
Positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the closest parent with position not equal to static).
If there’s no such ancestor, it’s positioned relative to the <html> (the page itself).
4. fixed
The element is fixed relative to the viewport (browser window).
It stays in the same place even when you scroll.
Commonly used for headers, footers, or sticky menus.
5. sticky
The element acts like relative until you scroll past a certain point.
Then it sticks to a defined position (like fixed).
Requires a top (or bottom) value and a scrolling container.1234
